The avatars in this folder are taken from: http://www.allavatars.com

Allavatars.com is a site started by artists who wanted to keep control
of how their work was used for online avatars, and make sure it was presented
in sufficient quality. The images we have included here are only a sampling
of the large collection available at the link above. Feel free to browse
the site and select another avatar - they are all free to use (but there are
restrictions on using them as part of a package, which is why the selection
here is not larger).

Avatars not in this folder are taken from classical works of art that are
public domain.
